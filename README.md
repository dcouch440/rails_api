```

* If you wish to keep these private you can also use a credentials password
  
* See this link to learn how to do so. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHgvPPr2nLE )

```
 for vs code users try
  EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```


* within the authentication_app directory of the project create your databases with

```
rails db:create
```

```
rails db:migrate
```

* From here to start the server you will need to type in:
